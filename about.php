        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><strong>We're a small agency with a massive reach.</strong><br><br>Established in 1946, the BLM is today the nation's largest land manager. Our roots go back to the years after America's independence, when the young nation began acquiring additional lands. At first, these lands were used to encourage homesteading and westward migration. The General Land Office was created in 1812 to support this national goal.
<br><br>Over time, values and attitudes regarding public lands shifted, and President Harry S. Truman, by means of a government reorganization, merged the GLO and another agency, the U.S. Grazing Service, creating the Bureau of Land Management. Learn more about our origins and how the BLM evolved over time in  "Opportunity and Challenge: The Story of the BLM."
<br><br>We manage 245 million acres of public lands—that's one in ten acres in the country—and 700 million acres of mineral estate. These public lands and subsurface acres are integral to the lives and livelihoods of communities and families across the country. This is accomplished by 12 main regional offices and headquarter offices in Grand Junction, Colorado and in Washington, DC.</p>
